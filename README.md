<h2>Java Program to manage Covid Cases (College Project - Software Development + Testing Module)</h2>

<p>Covid19 cases are recorded daily for the 5 highest counties in Ireland. On any given day the following information is recorded for each county: County name, Number of cases, Number of males, Number of females and Median age. A Covid class has been developed to record this information.<br>
  I was required to: <br>
• Write a program that will allow a user to enter the details for the 5 highest counties and write them to file;<br>
• Write another program that will allow a user to work with the data from the file on a menu-based system.<br/>
